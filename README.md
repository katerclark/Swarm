LOOK AT THIS BEFORE EXAMINING THE NEW CODE

We need to make a schematic of how turns will work
- how to switch turns
- change turns in either GameMaster or Player
- what a player will do on their turn
- place functions for specific turn in either GameMaster or Player

We also need to figure out how to make rows and columns more public in scope
- this will fix most of the red marks in the program (like on lines 88, 174, and 175 for example)
