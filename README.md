# Swarm

Game Summary: Swarm is a 2-player strategy guessing game (like battleship). The goal is to eliminate your opponent's swarm of bugs before they eliminate yours! Each player will first enter 10 coordinates to place their bugs on a grid. Then each player will take turns trying to hit the other player's swarm. The first player to eliminate their opponents swarm wins!

Requirements: Python 3

Installation Instructions: No libraries were used

How to run the game (command line): Player 1 indicates that they are ready by pressing the enter key. Player 1 types in a tuple of numbers (like 3,3) to place a bug on the board and does this until they run out of bugs. Player 2 presses enter and then places their bugs in the same manner. Once that is done, press enter. Player 1 selects a spot to attack on Player 2's board (like 3,3). Then press enter to switch turns. Then Player 2 selects a spot to attack on Player 1's board (like 3,3). Then press enter to switch turns. This goes on until all of the bugs are destroyed on one board. The terminal tells a player if they have hit or missed a bug and if they have won or not as well.
